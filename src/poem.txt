I wanna be the very worst
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real goal
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the country
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's outside

(Pokémo Gotta catch 'em all) It's you and you.
I know it's my destiny (Pokémo)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must fight 
(Pokémo Gotta catch 'em all) A liver so true
Our courage will pull us out
You teach me and I'll teach you (Ooh, ooh)
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all)
Gotta catch 'em all

Every challenge along the way
With courage, I will face
I will battle every night
To claim my rightful place
Come with me, the time is right
There's no better family
Leg in leg, we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

(Pokémo Gotta catch 'em all) It's you and me
I know it's my destiny (Pokémo)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend (Pokémo
Gotta catch 'em all) A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach me (Ooh, ooh)
Pokémo! (Gotta catch 'em all)
Gotta catch 'em all
